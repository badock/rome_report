\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This document gives an unformal view of what have been done for making OpenStack
leverage NoSQL databases. This document focus exclusively on the Nova service.
Our work has led us to first study how services in OpenStack collaborate and 
then to develop \emph{ROME}, an extension for KVS that enables
them to be used with the same interfaces as provided by emph{SQLAlchemy}. The
mechanisms that are used in ROME are described, and improvements are proposed in
section \ref{sec:future_work}.
